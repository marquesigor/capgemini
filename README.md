# Hello!

This repository was created to facilitate the analysis of the answers to the requested questions.
To test the answeres it is possible to call the methods through the main or to execute unit tests.
For the fourth exercise, I did not modify the main structure because you will be able to execute the class in isolation.
I paid attention to some concerns about the complexity of time.
I believe I can explain better my approach to solving the exercises by voice call.

Regards and stay Safe,

Igor Marques.
